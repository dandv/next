/**
 * The @qx.io.rest@ package consists of only one class: {@link Resource}.
 *
 * {@link Resource} allows to encapsulate the specifics of a REST interface.
 * Rather than requesting URLs with a specific HTTP method manually, a resource
 * representing the remote resource is instantiated and actions are invoked on this resource.
 * A resource with its actions can be configured declaratively or programatically.
